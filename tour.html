<p><strong>Note: this material is a work in progress.</strong></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this tour, we’ll practice spotting some of the layers of the “smart” city that are hidden in plain sight, collecting and storing data about our lives, as well as the kinds of thinking that justify their existence.</p>
<p>As we walk around downtown Seattle, we’ll refer to this <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/C15vnW0gtZybtY24eXREfy/Field-Guide-Prototype?node-id=0%3A1">field guide</a>. Map and photos coming soon.</p>
<h2 id="surveillance-cameras">Surveillance cameras</h2>
<p>As we walk around downtown, we’ll see many surveillance cameras—and they’ll see us.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>How do you think a surveillance camera sees you?</p>
<p>It’s not hard to get a sense of how a person sees you. The more you get to know a person, the more you get a sense of how they feel about you through what they do and say. If they like you personally, or they hold a prejudice against some part of who you are, it’ll likely come out in conversation.</p>
<p>A surveillance camera, though an unblinking and unbreathing machine, <em>also</em> sees you in a certain way. All the hardware and software of the camera, as well as the people “inside” the camera, together encode a certain kind of gaze. Based on what they see, they might act toward you in some way. But unlike a person, there’s no two-way flow of information, and no explanation for something that happens.</p>
<p>Cameras have always seen some people better. More broadly, sensors have always been built by certain groups of people to sense certain groups of people better than others.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> In her book “Darkness Matters,” Simone Browne argues that biometric technology privileges whiteness and is troubled by “dark matter”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dark matter being those bodies and body parts that trouble some biometric technology, like dark irises or cameras that “can’t see black people” or that ask some Asian users, “Did someone blink?” When particular surveillance technologies, in their development and design, leave out some subjects and communities for optimum usage, this leaves open the possibility of reproducing existing inequalities. (163)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And seeing and sensing have always been used as forms of control, especially over black and brown bodies. As Browne writes, “some light shines more brightly on some than on others… [and some] technologies of seeing [seek] to render the subject outside of the category of the human, <em>un</em>-visible.” (68)</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> How do you think a surveillance camera sees you? What have you experienced in Seattle?</p>
<p>Just walking around, we’ve been spotted by many surveillance cameras watching us. But again, a surveillance camera is not a person.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> How does a surveillance camera differ from an eye? How does a surveillance camera differ from a random passerby looking at you?</p>
<p>Let’s get specific about the hardware, software, and people operating it. (several answers included below)</p>
<ul>
<li>The camera has a memory. It can record video or other data and add it to a store of records over all time. That data can be analyzed for patterns and shared with other entities, both private (your neighbors) and public (the local police).</li>
<li>The people behind the camera tend to have <em>more</em> power than the average person in public space (security guards or police).</li>
<li>The camera can be controlled remotely: it can swivel, zoom, or change height.</li>
<li>It might be connected to a network (via Internet or radio frequency), which lets it send video to anywhere, receive instructions from anywhere, and lets other people, who might be anywhere, watch the video stream.</li>
<li>The camera might be insecure; that is, anyone on the network could break into it.</li>
<li>The camera can see things an eye can’t, such as temperature and infrared frequencies.</li>
<li>There might be many cameras connected to the same network in a city or building, sharing information (e.g. tracking the same person).</li>
<li>The camera can have different ways of seeing encoded in it, including kinds of gazes that enforce social agreements about what kinds of behavior and people are considered “normal”—and these gazes can be propagated all at once to the whole network of enforcement that the camera hooks into.</li>
<li>There are many more cameras in public space than one might expect: 500,000 in London, 30,000 in Chicago, 9,000 in New York, 46,000 in Beijing (and growing very fast in China to 600 million+ by 2020).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Question:</em> Now that we’ve broken down why a camera is not an eye, what do you all think is a better way to understand a street-level video surveillance system?</p>
<p>To understand surveillance, we also need to <em>watch</em>. Let’s try and get a sense of that.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Who’s watching? What’s it like on the other side? Has anyone here worked as a security guard? Can you tell us about your experience? What can a camera see, and what did <em>you</em> see?</p>
<p>The people who are watching can see a lot. Often data is piped to centers in cities called “real-time crime centers” to be displayed and analyzed. (Possible activity: <em>You’re the voyeur</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The biggest thing I’ve come across over the years working security is how much people think they can get away with things, or operate under the assumption that there aren’t cameras in an area, or the cameras aren’t recording. Which, to be fair, that’s sometimes the case. But 99 percent of the time, if they’ve done something stupid, it’s probably on camera. A control center operator has probably seen it or has been asked to look into it and found it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One recent example of seeing as a form of control was when the Seattle Police Department installed a SkyWatch tower in a parking lot in a Safeway in South Seattle, a heavily Japanese neighborhood. According to Stanley Shikuma, a board member of the Japanese American Citizens League’s Seattle chapter, this tower sends a clear message: “You are being watched. We have you in our sights. And like [at] the [Japanese internment] camps, the intent is to intimidate rather than protect.”</p>
<p>Coverage of this tower pointed out the police’s use of surveillance, which they justified by pointing to high crime rates, was just a <em>band-aid</em> on symptoms that arose from the underlying issue of a <em>destruction of community.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Silver Fork was a place to get hot links, grits, a middling cup of coffee and the company, mostly Black, of your neighbors and community leaders. It made the space feel activated, vibrant and safe, the kind of place you wouldn’t mess with because it was familial.</p>
<p>But Safeway replaced the restaurant with a gas station and convenience kiosk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This story shows how we can resist the <em>way of thinking</em> that props up the practice of surveillance. Justifications like “crime” are really symptoms of deeper causes that only will only be <em>exacerbated</em> by imposing coercive technologies from the top down. Instead, we can imagine and build futures that decenter control and center community.</p>
<p>In general, widespread video surveillance systems threaten individuals’ privacy, anonymity, and freedom of movement, and they’re vulnerable to abuse by people and institutions. They’re expensive systems that aren’t proven to “stop crime” or make people feel safer. The risks far outweigh the benefits! <!-- TODO: more concrete stories/citations --></p>
<p>One way that activists have resisted these systems is by “watching the watchers.” Groups in cities including NYC, LA, Chicago, and Seattle have worked on photographing surveillance cameras and mapping their locations, to make a usually opaque system more transparent to the public. We could join in that action right now as well. (Possible activity: <em>Spy v. Spy</em>)</p>
<!-- TODO: more social history discussion; also legal status -->
<h3 id="activities">Activities</h3>
<p><em>Spy v. Spy</em>: First, discuss the <a href="http://www.coveillance.org/camera-spotting">field guide to spotting surveillance cameras</a>, which gives more concrete details on kinds of cameras, how to spot them, and where they are usually found. Next, split up into pairs. Each pair competes to find, photograph, and map the most surveillance cameras in downtown. (Of course, be aware of your surroundings, be safe, be prepared for questions, and only photograph cameras in outdoor public space. Yes, what we’re doing is legal.)</p>

<h2 id="amazon-go">Amazon Go</h2>
<p>Visit Amazon Go, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/21/inside-amazons-surveillance-powered-no-checkout-convenience-store/">a surveillance-powered convenience store</a> at 2131 7th Ave, as well as the Seattle Spheres.</p>
<h3 id="overview-1">Overview</h3>
<p>Amazon Go is a convenience store without cashiers. Instead, cameras track your every move inside the store to determine what objects you’ve taken from the shelf, as well as your browsing habits, such as how long you hesitated before taking an item or whether you put an item back.</p>
<p>Is it a big deal if Amazon knows that you like bagels over waffles? Well, maybe not in and of itself. But be aware of a few things. First, Amazon is probably combining your data from the physical Amazon Go store with data about your online purchases. Say you’ve bought an item that reveals your political or religious beliefs—Hillary Clinton’s book, a Hanukkah decoration—and you also get a coffee every day at 8am. Now Amazon knows about your beliefs and where to reliably find you. What happens if those beliefs become persecuted? [e.g., raids on Muslim-Americans].</p>
<p>Second, once Amazon has your data, you’ve implicitly consented to whatever they want to do with that data. One way data is often used is to draw conclusions for advertisements. Ads have the power to shape individual beliefs and behavior—think about how teenage girls are affected by ads depicting impossible beauty standards. Targeted ads, which show ads based on your purchases and behavior, has an echo chamber effect, where the things you see reinforce your beliefs, which reinforces what Amazon shows you.</p>
<p>We don’t necessarily know how else data is being used, because there is little legal oversight. Can Amazon sell this data to the government? Can Amazon track your location, based on what stores you go to? What if Amazon is accidentally storing your data insecurely, and an employee can access it? Can Amazon use the photo of your face to generate other face photos? All of these situations have happened in the past.</p>
<p>Amazon Go is a tradeoff between convenience and surveillance. Day-to-day, surveillance is a mostly invisible price to pay, but it has the power to shape individual behavior as well as society.</p>

<h2 id="att-peering-site-nsa-wiretap-site">AT&amp;T peering site (NSA wiretap site)</h2>
<p>Visit <em>1122 3rd Avenue</em>, a site for AT&amp;T peering and one of the NSA’s eight wiretap rooms in the FAIRVIEW surveillance program.</p>
<h3 id="overview-2">Overview</h3>
<p>This stop on the tour highlights surveillance at the federal level, how surveillance relies on cooperation between the private and public sectors, and the dragnet quality of digital surveillance.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T handles a lot of data. According to <em>The Intercept</em>, “As of March 2018, some 197 petabytes of data – the equivalent of more than 49 trillion pages of text, or 60 billion average-sized mp3 files – traveled across [AT&amp;T]’s networks every business day.” Because AT&amp;T’s so big, it’s called a Tier 1 provider, so other networks exchange their network capacity with AT&amp;T (called “peering”) or pay AT&amp;T to transmit traffic on its network (called “transit”). The way that two networks peer is that their infrastructure physically meets in a building, often via an Ethernet switch in a carrier hotel or a “meet-me room,” so data can be exchanged between the networks. That’s what’s happening in this building and in the Westin Exchange.</p>
<p>So, even if your Internet service provider isn’t AT&amp;T and you don’t live in the US, if your provider peers with AT&amp;T anywhere in the chain, your emails and Facebook messages might enter AT&amp;T’s network, onto US soil, into one of the AT&amp;T peering hubs, where NSA equipment can siphon it off to Maryland to be stored, processed, collated against your profile and that of people you know.</p>
<p>The NSA is able to spy on massive amounts of Internet traffic passing through the US because of its partnership with AT&amp;T, even lauding AT&amp;T’s “extreme willingness to help.” The NSA can read non-US citizens’ communications with impunity. For example, the NSA has used its wiretap hub in NYC (called Titanpointe) to eavesdrop on the phone communications of the United Nations, the World Bank, and at least 38 countries, including allies like Germany, Japan, and France. However, there are regulations against reading US citizens’ communications.</p>
<p>The eight NSA hubs, or AT&amp;T peering rooms, for FAIRVIEW are in Seattle, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Dallas, DC, and Atlanta. Is NSA equipment still in this building, intercepting communications that pass through Seattle and funneling it to Maryland for NSA analysts to look at? Yeah, probably. Incidentally, this location is very close to both the FBI Seattle office and the Pacific-1 intercontinental undersea cable.</p>

<li>How does it feel to be physically close to a central portion of federal/international internet/surveillance infrastructure through which a massive amount of information is flowing?</li>

<p>Visit the Acylica installations + Skywave antennas at 7th Ave &amp; Lenora St and at 2901 Western Ave.</p>
<h3 id="overview-3">Overview</h3>
<p>The writer Heinrich Boll tells the story of a veteran who becomes injured in the war and is assigned a job counting people for the city government:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They have patched up my legs and given me a job I can do sitting down: I count the people crossing the bridge. They get such a kick out of it, documenting their efficiency with figures; … my soundless mouth ticks away like clockwork, piling number on number, just so I can present them each evening with the triumph of a figure.</p>
<p>They beam delightedly when I hand over the results of my day’s labors, the higher the figure the broader their smiles, and they have every reason to hug themselves when they climb into bed, for many thousands of pedestrians cross their new bridge every day…</p>
<p>Horse-drawn vehicles are, of course, a piece of cake. There’s nothing to it. There are never more than a couple of dozen horse-drawn vehicles a day, and to tick over the next number in your brain once every half hour—what a cinch!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is how “smart cities” used to work before people invented technologies to track and sense other people. Fast-forward thirty years, and the Acylica system is the latest step in the trend of private companies selling smart technologies to knowledge-hungry cities. What the veteran does is basically what Acyclica does: it counts people and cars so people in the city government can know more about flows of traffic and pedestrians, and maybe try and alleviate traffic. The <em>Crosscut</em> article reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new system will provide a much more detailed picture [of traffic]: while Bluetooth readers capture 5-7 percent of cars passing intersections, the Wi-Fi readers capture nearly 50 percent from cars with smartphones or tablets with Wi-Fi turned on.</p>
<p>As the car passes more readers, algorithms are run to calculate speed, distance, time and general behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way that Acyclica tracks people is a really souped-up way of assigning a soldier to make tally marks on paper whenever a horse-drawn carriage passes by. It counts cars by exploiting the poor design of the Wi-fi protocol (the protocol that governs how devices connect to networks wirelessly). The Acyclica device is a little gray box with an antenna that casts a fake Wi-fi network and tracks the phones and computers that try to join the network as they pass by in passing cars. Different Acyclica installations can track your devices’ unique identifiers as you pass them in the city.</p>
<p>Why is Acyclica able to do this? Well, you ever wonder how your phone or laptop auto-connects to Wi-fi networks? To do this, your device is shouting to the world a ton of your personal information in something called a <em>probe packet</em>. A probe packet contains the unique name of your device (called a MAC address—which is kind of like your Social Security Number, but for a device), as well as the list of all the past Wi-fi networks that your device has tried to join before. The Wi-fi protocol design is widely recognized to be a privacy disaster, and not only is Acyclica exploiting it, but many other advertising and surveillance firms have built similar devices, for example sticking devices in trash cans to track shoppers as they walk around a mall:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The marketing materials don’t say this, but it might also be possible to attach specific attributes to the MAC addresses that are collected. A phone that goes into the women’s room probably belongs to a female, for instance, while a MAC address entering the Big and Tall clothing retailer probably belongs to a person of large carriage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yes, while we are standing here right now, this little box is collecting your phones’ names, and as we pass different boxes, the system will gather our data and collate our movements. The simple but ungainly way to protect yourself is to turn off wifi on your smart device, or to not carry a smart device. However, that doesn’t scrub your data or protect others.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> How do people feel about how Acyclica is collecting their data? What could go wrong? What does the process of coercive data collection “feel” like—a mosquito bite? a highway robbery?</p>
<p>This technology raises many questions around data privacy and consent. How long is data stored? How is data transmitted? Who has access to view this data? How is the data anonymized? Acyclica collects incredibly sensitive information at a high detail of granularity about people’s movements around the city. Were members of the public asked for consent before the system was installed? No. As one citizen commented during a Seattle Surveillance Ordinance hearing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I certainly have not agreed for the city of Seattle or any vendors to track the position of my phone as it moves throughout the city whether or not that data is properly anonymized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One big issue is data escaping scope. The Seattle city government may promise certain things about the data, but data that govermnment agencies collect historically has a funny way of being stored for longer than promised and shared with other agencies (like ICE or law enforcement) or quasi-private entities (like Palantir) and used to circumscribe the movements of members of marginalized communities.</p>
<p>We need to question the <em>surveillance thinking</em> that props up this Acyclica installation. The <em>Crosscut</em> article finishes with one prime example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this case, the ultimate question may be what concerns people more: the specter of overly surveillant law enforcement, or the prospect of spending yet another hour stuck in traffic?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can resist the assumption that there’s a tradeoff, that without the <em>current</em> surveillance technology which is assumed to work perfectly and already “waiting in the wings,” we will suffer a terrible loss of convenience, a return to the “bad old days.” This is false. Where is the proof that the tech works? Do we need to count in the first place? And don’t we have the imagination to propose a way to count cars without gathering granular location data? We can resist the slow erosion of privacy in the name of convenience and intelligence.</p>

<h2 id="bluetooth-beacon">Bluetooth beacon</h2>
<p>We will visit Bluetooth beacons at a commercial location (TBD).</p>
<p><img src="media/beaconheader.png" width="500"></p>
<p>If a personal investigator were to follow you on a shopping trip, here’s what they might write down about you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At 3:31pm today, you entered the local Target. You walked past a display of Chips Ahoy and ever-so-briefly paused (noted). You saw a display of black shirts (noted) and spent 5.5 minutes examining them, spending 90% more time near the medium-sized rack (noted).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bluetooth beacons are like a personal spy for stores. Beacons can know exactly where you are in a store—not just “you are at Target” but “you are in the center of snacks aisle, standing next to the applesauce.”</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> Why is it necessary to know someone’s exact location? How would life be different if this capability was taken away?</p>
<p>Knowing your exact location is really useful if you’re a spy (or a marketer)! When you walk past the applesauce, the Target app can offer you a deal to motivate you to make a purchase. If you paused next to chips but then continued on, Target might send you a coupon to sway you to get the chips next time. The data from the beacons might also be used by other people—either Target rented them out, or the beacons were not secured—so you don’t really know who is collecting your data, or what they’re doing with it.</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> What motivates the developers of apps to make the app compatible with Bluetooth? Who exactly are these app developers? (See below: <em>Expansions: Big Tech in Beacons</em>)</p>
<p>Bluetooth beacons gather data about you by pinging a compatible app on your phone when you walk past. The app could be the Target app, or an innocuous-seeming news or weather app that also has Bluetooth location function. (If you have no such app, you’re safe.)</p>
<p>Beacons are in stores and malls, and also in places like airports, public transit, gyms, museums, and more. Do you remember consenting to having your location exactly tracked, or having this data sold to… whoever? Would you be surprised if a personal investigator followed you to these places?</p>
<p><em>Question:</em> What rights do people have in public places (like subway stations)? What rights do companies have in public places? Is it different if you’re in a store? What is the current status of regulation? (See below: <em>Expansions: Regulation</em>).</p>

<h3 id="expansions---additional-info-for-facilitators">Expansions - Additional Info for Facilitators</h3>
<p>Below are some additional topics, FAQs, and responses to discussion questions, for facilitators to read through. It’s intended to help the facilitator prepare, and which sections to be incorporated is up to them.</p>
<h4 id="big-tech-in-beacons">Big Tech in Beacons</h4>
<p>Apple, Google, Facebook and other big tech companies have had a large role in developing Bluetooth beacons. All three companies have their own beacon products. Apple developed <a href="http://www.ibeacon.com/what-is-ibeacon-a-guide-to-beacons/">iBeacon</a>, the technological standard for communication between apps and the beacon. Google and Facebook have both mailed beacons to stores and small businesses for free and created their own <a href="https://developers.google.com/beacons/">developer tools</a> for easy usage.</p>
<p>Why would Big Tech get involved? For one, the beacons may be integrated with another product. For example, Facebook’s Bluetooth Beacons automatically push notifications containing Facebook Place Tips, including prompts to like the business’s page on Facebook or to check in on Facebook (<a href="https://adespresso.com/blog/facebooks-bluetooth-beacon-should-your-business-get-one/">source</a>). Big Tech companies may also be eager to “join” the beacon data with other data they already have about you.</p>
<h4 id="current-legislation-and-regulations">Current Legislation and Regulations</h4>
<p>The most recent applicable laws were written in the 1980s, for a very different world.</p>
<p>First, it may not even be illegal to hack a Bluetooth beacon. The most relevant law might be the 1984 <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1030.html">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</a>, which is used to prosecute hackers and prevent unauthorized access to computers. But do beacons count as computers? It’s unlikely, since even smartphones are a gray area - “It is <em>possible</em> that a court of law would consider a smartphone to be a type of computer.” (<a href="https://www.privacyrights.org/consumer-guides/smartphone-privacy">Privacy Rights Clearinghouse</a>)</p>
<p>What about the actual location data, which is sensitive? With a few exceptions, it’s not regulated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Federal law does not directly regulate location tracking or the collection, sale, or use of personal location data.” (<a href="https://businesslawtoday.org/2019/03/power-place-geolocation-tracking-privacy/#_ftn53">Business Law Today</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even when location tracking is regulated, the requirements “generally apply only to the initial data collector,” - in our case, the app that initially connects with the Bluetooth beacons. The data that the beacons collect is regularly resold or used for some opaque purpose, but there’s no regulation around this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“(1) identified location data is regularly acquired and used by third parties with whom the individual has no direct relationship, and (2) de-identified or anonymized location data is regularly combined with identified personal data and used by third parties with whom the individual has no direct relationship to compile comprehensive profiles of the individual. These secondary-market practices are not currently addressed by U.S. law.” (<a href="https://businesslawtoday.org/2019/03/power-place-geolocation-tracking-privacy/">Business Law Today</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A new law in California, to go into effect in 2020, is the first to tackle “Security of Connected Devices,” requiring devices such as Bluetooth Beacons to have “reasonable security features.” (<a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-to-know-about-new-calif-connected-74765/">source</a>). However, it’s not specified in the law what security features would count.</p>
<p>What if location tracking was opt-in? Currently, in the EU, websites with cookies are mandated to alert users of their cookie usage, and provide a “opt-in” button to explicitly click. Perhaps a similar law could take effect for location tracking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If the sellers of mobile phone applications are obliged to use similar pop-up windows when collecting location data, users would be aware of the fact that their location data is being collected. The screenshot below displays a sample pop-up window that can be used for obtaining users’ consent to collect location data from beacons.” (<a href="https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/privacy-risks-beacons/#gref">Infosec Institute</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="how-do-bluetooth-beacons-really-work">How do Bluetooth Beacons really work?</h4>
<p>Here’s a great succinct explanation and image from a beacon manufacturer (<a href="https://www.beaconstac.com/what-is-a-bluetooth-beacon">source</a>):</p>
<p><img src="media/beaconillust.png" width="500"></p>
<p>“Let’s assume beacons are deployed at the entrance of a coffee shop.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>These beacons transmit signals in its range. [Ed: Beacons are constantly transmitting small packets of information, waiting for a phone to pick it up. You can think of the beacon as a bat making echolocation noises every so often to see if there are prey (the phones) around.] The range of beacons vary from 20m to 300m.</li>
<li>Smartphones in the range of beacons is itself indicating that the smartphones are nearby.</li>
<li>The smartphone then sends the ID number attached to the signal to the cloud server. [Ed: You can think of the cloud server as “facebook.com” or “target.com”, some central faraway place that is gathering and processing information.]</li>
<li>The server responds with the action linked to the beacon ID. It could be a notification introducing a new appetizer in the cafe, combo deals, video of coffee making or a feedback form!</li>
<li>These notifications drive customers to a webpage, a form, a phone number or whatever you plan to do.”</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="how-are-bluetooth-beacons-different-from-other-types-of-location-surveillance">How are Bluetooth Beacons different from other types of location surveillance?</h4>
<p>Great question! Bluetooth may seem similar to Acyclica in that they both use small devices in public places to track people. It may even seem similar to apps on your phone that use GPS, since they both end up tracking location.</p>
<p>What sets Bluetooth beacons apart is its granularity - it can work well indoors. GPS is accurate up to a few meters, making it only useful for outdoor location; Bluetooth is accurate <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/28/bluetooth-gains-direction-finding-for-location-accuracy-to-the-centimeter/">on the order of centimeters</a>. GPS can know whether you are at the mall; Bluetooth can know which store in the mall you’re in and even which clothing display you are next to.</p>
<p>Next, Bluetooth beacons are efficient and easy for stores to adopt. Beacons are really cheap - a beacon costs less than 25 dollars, and many big tech companies give them away for free. They don’t require an internet connection, and they can run on a few batteries for a long time.</p>

<p>Visit an automated license plate reader (ALPR). Location TBD. There are 99 static LPRs installed throughout the city. They are <a href="http://www.pipstechnology.com/fixedalpr/">PIPS P372 cameras</a>.</p>
<h3 id="overview-4">Overview</h3>
<p>Automatic License Plate Readers (ALPR), unsurprisingly, capture the license plates of cars that drive by. License plates are important because they uniquely identify a person—the government can look up who a license plate belongs to at a DMV. They are posted in street corners around Seattle. There is no public map, since the city doesn’t want to lose money from people evading speeding tickets.</p>
<p>Well, if you’re not speeding, so what? First, ALPRs take pictures of your license plate even when there are no traffic violations. According to the city of Seattle, this is to keep track of traffic congestion. Second, with ALPRs located in many places around the city, the government could conceivably track your location, or the location history of any given person. Where you go can reveal a lot about you and can be used against you—for example, the NYPD collected license plates of people parked at mosques, in an “unapologetic approach to protecting the city from terrorism.” Third, who gets access to this data, and how is it stored? Although Dept. of Transportation employees receive “training” to use the system, what prevents a malicious user from tracking their ex-partner, and is there any oversight? Currently, there is no legal requirement to audit or delete this data.</p>
