# Watching the watchers: a workshop

<img src="media/bbox3.png" width="850">

**Note: this material is a work in progress.**

In 2019, if you spend time in a major city (like Seattle) and spend any time online (like most of us do), chances are, you're almost constantly being watched. You probably know that, in a general way. But how exactly are you being watched, and what can you do about it?

This workshop is a hands-on introduction to identifying how you're being watched in daily life. The goal is to cut through paranoia and hype: we will start with a presentation that aims to demystify surveillance systems. We will then take a walk to learn to spot surveillance infrastructure in downtown Seattle and finish by splitting up to do deep dives in areas of your interest.

Afterward, the next time you go outside or online, you should have a much better idea of how you're being watched and how you can take action.

The workshop will run about two and a half hours:

* 15 mins: opening group discussion
* 30 mins: background and introduction to surveillance systems and how they encroach on civil liberties, covering the topics outlined [here](http://www.coveillance.org/toolkit)
* 1 hour: community walk to spot surveillance infrastructure in public space, visiting the stops outlined [here](http://www.coveillance.org/tour)
* 30 mins: split up in groups to do deep dives in different areas (for example,  contributing to a community-driven AI to identify surveillance cameras in images)
* 15 mins: closing group discussion + overview of ways to continue taking action with the ACLU of Washington and other partners

If you can, please bring a camera or camera-equipped phone and a laptop.

Note: we are piloting this material, so things may change and we will ask participants for feedback!
