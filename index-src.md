In 2019, if you spend time in a major city (like Seattle) and spend any time online (like most of us do), chances are, you're almost constantly being watched. As you walk to the bus stop, as you sit on the bus, as you drive downtown, as you enter a cafe and get on the wifi, and even in your home, as you call a friend. You're probably being listened to and recorded as well. Most likely, your actions will be compared to your past actions, added to massive databases of peoples' histories, and mined for profit. Your data will be used to influence your future actions and others' actions, and in ways you never predicted or agreed to in the future---for example, as evidence in court against you or someone else.

Mass surveillance is the reality of living in 2019. And you probably know that, in a general way. But how exactly are you being watched, and what can you do about it?

This site is a hands-on introduction to identifying how you're being watched in daily life. The goal is to cut through paranoia and hype.

If you are a newcomer, start here!  presentation that aims to demystify surveillance systems. Then, check out the self-guided notes for [a walking tour of surveillance infrastructure in downtown Seattle](http://www.coveillance.org/tour). Afterward, the next time you go outside or online, you should have a much better idea of how you're being watched and how you can take action.

If you an advocate/organizer, or you're just hungry for more, check out the [people's surveillance toolkit](http://www.coveillance.org/toolkit) for a deeper discussion about the practice of surveillance and why it matters. This page is intended to be a guide for facilitators leading a group discussion.

We are also facilitating in-real-life [workshops](http://www.coveillance.org/workshop) using this material! We would love for you to join us. Our next workshop is [date TBD]. You can add yourself to this mailing list to be alerted when there are new upcoming workshops. You can also read through the site for a self-guided workshop, or use what we have to run your own workshop!
