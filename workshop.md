# Watching the watchers: a workshop

![](media/bbox3.png)

In 2019, if you spend time in a major city (like Seattle) and spend any time online (like most of us do), chances are, you're almost constantly being watched. As you walk to the bus stop, as you sit on the bus, as you drive downtown, as you enter a cafe and get on the wifi, and even in your home, as you call a friend. You're probably being listened to and recorded as well. Most likely, your actions will be compared to your past actions, added to massive databases of peoples' histories, and mined for profit. Your data will be used to influence your future actions and others' actions, and in ways you never predicted or agreed to in the future---for example, as evidence in court against you or someone else.

Mass surveillance is the reality of living in 2019. And you probably know that, in a general way. But how exactly are you being watched, and what can you do about it?

This workshop is a hands-on introduction to identifying how you're being watched in daily life. The goal is to cut through paranoia and hype: we will start with a presentation that aims to demystify how technologies like AI and networking work and how they are used in large-scale surveillance systems. We will then take a walk to identify surveillance infrastructure in downtown Seattle and finish by contributing to a community-driven AI to identify surveillance cameras in images. Afterward, the next time you go outside or online, you should have a much better idea of how you're being watched and how you can take action.

The workshop will run about three hours:

* 15 mins: opening group discussion
* 30 mins: background and introduction to large-scale AI-powered surveillance systems and how they encroach on civil liberties globally, covering the topics outlined [here](ai-intro.html)
* 1 hour: community walk to spot and photograph surveillance cameras and other infrastructure in public space, visiting the stops [here](tour.md)
* 30 mins: collaborative labeling of surveillance cameras in the dataset we created
* 15 mins: closing group discussion + overview of ways to continue taking action with ACLU WA and partners

If you can, please bring a camera or camera-equipped phone and a laptop.
